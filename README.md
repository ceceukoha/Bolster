# About Bolster


Bolster is an online platform that connects consumers to the nearest plastic waste recycler. Consumers indicate the pickup location and quantity of waste. Recyclers pay an amount of money in exchange for the waste. A badge reward system is used to encourage the proper disposal of waste.

Bolster is centered on influencing the behavior of individuals towards the reuse of plastic products, by facilitating the exchange of waste between consumers and recyclers.

The solution is currently managed by [Chidinma Oduenyi](http://github.com/Chisequ), [Chioma Ukoha-Kalu](http://github.com/ceceukoha), [John Achimugu](https://github.com/Johnalex-hub) , [Paul Ehigie](https://github.com/Ehigiepaul01)
